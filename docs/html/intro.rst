Summary
------------------------------------------------

This paper is a theoretical, also practical, exercise in the consolidation of like applications for 
different environments.  These are generally seen across environmental application stacks for the 
purpose of testing all stages of the application life cycle.  

Broad examples could include the following:

- *Non-Production Environments*

  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
  - Quality Acceptance Testing (QAT)
  - System Integration Testing (SIT)

- *Development Environments*

  - Development (dev)
  - Testing (tst)

- *Production Environments*

  - Blue/Green deployment stacks
  - production stacks

This paper will demonstrate, using the development as an example environment pattern from the 
previous list, using NGINX to consolidate environment fqdn's for the purpose of grouping like 
applications and the simplification of EAP application policies for ease of management.
